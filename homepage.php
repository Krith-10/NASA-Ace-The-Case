                <b><h3 style="color:black; font-family: sans-serif">What is Biodiversity?</h3></b>
<p>Earth supports a diverse spectrum of life. Over billions of years, life has
evolved into a variety of forms—from microorganisms to our own species—
reflecting the rich array of environmental conditions present on our
changing planet.
Biological diversity, or biodiversity, refers to the variety of all life on Earth—
on all levels, from genes to species, ecosystems, and biomes. While it is
believed that Earth supports approximately 3 to 10 million species, only
about 1.5 million have been given a scientific name. Biodiversity is critical
for maintaining balanced ecosystems and provides a plethora of ecosystem
goods and services such as clean air, fresh water, waste removal, food,
fiber, and medicines.</p>

<img style="padding-left: 300px;"src="images/LPspin.gif" alt="Earth">
<h3 style="color: black">Using Earth Observations
    to Understand Biodiversity</h3>
<p>NASA is working in collaboration with experts from other federal agencies, universities, private companies, non-governmental organizations, and
international institutions to study patterns of biodiversity and understand
how biodiversity is changing. In particular, they are using both passive
and active satellite and airborne remote sensing technologies to directly
observe and identify biodiversity patterns, such as the distribution of
ecosystems and vegetation structure, as well as the environmental parameters that influence them such as topography and climate conditions.
Together, these observations strengthen our understanding of ecosystem
function and Earth’s biodiversity</p>

    <h3 style="color:black">WHAT IS THE ARCTIC?</h3>
<p>The Arctic is one of the coldest regions on Earth. Scientifically defined as
the region north of the Arctic Circle (located at 66° 33’ N latitude), the Arctic can be loosely defined by its icy waters largely bound by treeless land.
The extent of sea ice atop the cool, nutrient rich Arctic Ocean expands
and contracts in rhythm with the seasons, which oscillate between total
darkness and total daylight, year after year. Cooler temperatures and frozen soil limit the number of trees and other shrubs that grow in the Arctic;
in fact, our planet’s northernmost tree line currently hovers near the Arctic’s southern edge.For the past several decades, Earth-observing satellites have enabled continuous global observations of our home planet, and have played an especially important role in revealing the magnitude of change in remote, difficult
to access locations like the Arctic. Over the last decade, satellite data—
often combined with data from other sources—have revealed that the Arctic is changing at rates faster than anywhere else on Earth. These changes
include dramatic reductions in minimum sea-ice extent; alterations of landscape resulting from thawing of frozen soil, or permafrost; increases in phytoplankton productivity; changes in the extent and types of vegetation found
in the Arctic; and changes in the intensity of storms impacting Arctic coasts.
As temperatures rise in the Arctic, the extent of sea ice declines. Sea ice is
highly reflective of the Sun’s energy; therefore, reductions in sea ice impact
Earth’s radiation budget. Rather than reflecting most of the Sun’s energy,
ice-free areas absorb sunlight causing subsequent warming of the ocean.
Warmer ocean temperatures in turn impact Arctic coastlines, which can
cause permafrost to thaw and rates of erosion to accelerate. The warming
can also change global ocean and atmosphere circulations that subsequently affect weather patterns. Changes in the Arctic environment are
interrelated and have both long- and short-term effects on Earth’s land
surfaces, oceans, and atmosphere, ultimately impacting the Earth’s climate system. </p>

<h3 style="color: black">Earth’s Ocean</h3>
<p>Viewed from space, Earth appears as a blue marble, as approximately
70% of Earth’s surface is covered by ocean water. The vast ocean holds
roughly 97% of the planet’s water and represents 99% of the living space
on Earth. Below the surface, the ocean is teeming with life; in fact, most of
our planet’s lifeforms live in the ocean, from tiny microscopic organisms to
the enormous blue whale—the largest known animal on Earth.The world is getting warmer. Most of this warming has occurred since the
1970s, with the 20 warmest years having occurred since 1981 and with
all 10 of the warmest years occurring in the past 12 years. The ocean has
absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 700 meters (about
2,300 feet) of ocean showing a warming of 0.302 degrees Fahrenheit since
1969. With global average sea surface temperatures on the rise, scientists
have also noticed a decline in phytoplankton in many ocean regions.</p>

<h3 style="color: black">What is Biomass?</h3>
<p>Biomass is living or once-living biological material. Strictly speaking
then, all life is biomass. All plants and animals on Earth today will at
some point die and decay—ashes to ashes, dust to dust. In most cases, however, when we use the term in this brochure, we are referring to
vegetation—living or dead. </p>
<h3 style="color: black">Biomass Burning</h3>
<p>Biomass burning is the act of burning living, or once-living, biological
material. Formerly believed to occur mainly in the tropics, Earth-observing satellites have revealed a global distribution of biomass burning. Although huge fires, often visible from space, occur in the savanna
grasslands of Africa and South America and tropical forests in South
America and Southeast Asia, they can take place wherever vegetation
is abundant. Boreal forests for example—found at much higher latitudes—are major sources of biomass burning.
Biomass burning results from either: 1) natural processes, such as ignition
by lightning strikes; or 2) anthropogenic (i.e., human-induced) activity, such
as burning vegetation for agricultural land clearing and preparing existing
fields for planting. Although natural and anthropogenic biomass burning
can occur almost anywhere on the globe, the majority of biomass burning in the tropics stems from human causes, whereas in extra-tropical
regions—such as boreal forests—natural causes are more common.</p>

<p>NASA is well known for observating space, but the agency also has a strong hand in monitoring Earth. NASA's Earth 
    Observing System (EOS) is a collection of satellites designed to monitor and understand key components of the climate system
    and their interactions over an extended period.<br>

"NASA and other space agencies had launched satellites to study [Earth] before," the agency said in a press release after EOS 
had operated for a decade and a half. "But the past 15 years have produced a more comprehensive look at Earth from space than any other period in history. At a time when our planet is undergoing critically important changes, this global
view offers not only stunning imagery but also vitally important information about how Earth is changing."</p>
